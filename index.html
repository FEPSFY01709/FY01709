          With issues caused by global warming and pollution becoming more prevalent society needs to cut down on CO2 emissions
          and find environmentally friendly alternatives for many of our energy sources. This also includes finding alternatives
          for the automobile engine. By looking at positives and the negatives of the two main hydrogen engines, the hydrogen 
          internal combustion engine and the hydrogen fuel cell, this article aims to determine if hydrogen engines are a suitable 
          alternative for natural gas engines. Through the findings of this article, it can be determined that both engines can be
          seen as carbon emission free, but they have issues regarding the storage of hydrogen and the hydrogen fuel cell is very
          expensive to manufacture. The conclusion that can be drawn is that hydrogen engines need more research and development
          to overcome its issues, however when these issues have been resolved hydrogen engines can be a good alternative for
          natural gas engines.

      <h3 id="Introduction"><u>Introduction</u></h3>
      <pre>
        In the modern day a problem engineers are faced with is the protection of the enviroment. One of the biggest issues to be
        solved is finding an enviromentally friendly alternative for automobile engines. To find out if hydrogen engines could be 
        this alternative, this article looks at the pros and cons of two hydrogen engine types. Firstly, the hydrogen internal 
        combustion engine and secondly, the hydrogen fuel cell.
      </pre>
      
      <h3 id="Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine"><u>Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine</u></h3>
      <pre>
        Hydrogen internal combustion engines (ICE) are in their layout and functionality very similar to natural gas ICEs. 
        They are made up out of the same main components, such as a cylinder, cylinder head, piston, piston rings, connecting rod, 
        crankshaft, crank case and a flywheel. The principle of how a hydrogen combustion engine produces energy is also the same 
        as in a natural gas ICE. Through inlet valves hydrogen and air are pushed into the combustion chamber, where with the help 
        of an igniter the fuel is ignited, causing a combustion. The force of the combustion causes the piston to be pushed down, 
        which forces the crankshaft to rotate (Office of energy efficiency & renewable energy (22nd November 2013)). 
        Through this rotation different types of machinery can be powered, for example the wheels on a car.

        There are also differences between natural gas ICEs and hydrogen ICEs. A key feature of a hydrogen combustion engine is 
        that the main product of the combustion reaction is water (Engineering Explained,2018), making it carbon emission free. 
        However, if the combustion reaction produces enough heat nitrogen-oxide can be produced as a by-product, which is a 
        pollutant. This can become a problem due to hydrogens characteristics of being easily ignited. 
        The positive of this aspect is the engine needs less ignition energy (ScienceDirect, no date) and starts quicker. 
        The problem as mentioned before is if the heat within the combustion engines reaches a high temperature nitrogen-oxide
        is formed. On top of that if there is a hotspot within the combustion chamber the gas is more likely to combust 
        (ScienceDirect, no date), which will cause the engine to miss fire. Another perk of hydrogen as a fuel source is that it 
        can run on a wide range of air to fuel ratios. This means that per hydrogen molecules more oxygen can be mixed into the 
        combustion chamber and combustion would still take place. By using a mixture with more oxygen per hydrogen the reaction 
        produces less heat, which reduces or eliminates the production of nitrogen-oxide (ScienceDirect, no date). The biggest 
        challenge hydrogen ICEs face is the storage of hydrogen. Because hydrogen has a very low density the fuel tank required to 
        transport hydrogen would have to be very large (Hosseini, S. & Butler, B.,2019), which would reduce the available space in an 
        automobile. There are two methods currently in use to store hydrogen. Firstly, in high pressure cylinders and secondly in 
        liquid cryogenic form. Both methods are not very energy efficient, due to the high energy required to store them in these ways.

      <h3 id="Hydrogen Fuel Cell"><u>Hydrogen Fuel Cell</u></h3>
      <pre>
        A hydrogen fuel cell functions by producing electricity to charge an onboard electric motor. It consists of multiple membrane 
        electrode assemblies, which are put together to make a larger fuel cell block. A membrane electrode assembly is made up of three 
        parts (Office of energy efficiency & renewable energy, no date). Firstly, the polymer electrolyte membrane, which is a specific 
        membrane that only allows protons to pass through it. This membrane sits between the catalyst layers that function as the anode 
        and cathode of the membrane electrode assembly. They are made up of platinum particles dispersed on a base carbon surface area 
        mixed with ion-conducting polymers, also known as ionomers. The platinum is used as a catalyst. On the anode it causes the 
        hydrogen electrons to split from the hydrogen electrons and on the cathode, it causes oxygen to react with the hydrogen, causing 
        the production of water. Lastly the membrane electrode assemblies consist of gas diffusion layer, which allow the reactants 
        hydrogen and oxygen to be transported. They are made up of a sheet of carbon paper that is partially coated with 
        polytetrafluoroethylene, which is hydrophobic. This sheet allows gases to diffuse through pores. The way electric energy is 
        produced is splitting the hydrogen protons and electrons at the anode. The protons can then with the help of the ionomers travel 
        past the membrane to the cathode, but the electrons are forced to travel along a wire attached from the anode to the cathode. 
        This causes electricity to be inducted. Once the electrons reach the cathode the hydrogen and oxygen react with one another causing 
        water to be produced. The water in form of vapour can be diffused through the gas diffusion layer. The produced electricity is used 
        to power an electric motor.

        Like the hydrogen ICE hydrogen fuel cells produce water through its reaction (Office of energy efficiency & renewable energy, no date),
        but there is no risk of producing nitrogen-oxide as a by-product. This makes the use of the engine pollutant free. However, there are 
        two issues with the use and production of hydrogen fuel cells. Firstly, just like with the hydrogen ICEs it is difficult to store 
        the hydrogen. Because of the difficulty of storing hydrogen cars using a hydrogen fuel cell have limited travel range (Feldman B., 2005). 
        The second issue with hydrogen fuel cells is the high price of production. Hydrogen fuel cells need a lot of platinum to function and 
        since platinum is a very expensive metal it is extremely costly to produce hydrogen fuel cells (Feldman B., 2005).

      <h3 id="Conclusion"><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
      <pre>
        In conclusion although both the hydrogen internal combustion engine and hydrogen fuel cell can be seen as environmentally friendly, 
        they still face issues, like how to store the hydrogen as well as pricing issues. If these are overcome in the future it could be 
        possible that hydrogen engines will become a commonly used engine type in the modern world.
